# Diabetes Health Indicators Analysis

This project analyzes health indicators for diabetes prediction using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset from 2015.

## Project Objectives
- To identify key health, lifestyle, and demographic factors influencing diabetes risk.
- To develop machine learning models to predict diabetes cases based on these factors.
- To visualize and interpret feature importance and provide actionable insights.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

### Code Files
 **`ICS474_Project.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing all the project steps, including:
    - Data loading and preprocessing
    - Exploratory data analysis
    - Model training and evaluation
    - Feature importance analysis

### Dataset Files
1. **`diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`**: The main dataset used for analysis.
2. **`diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`**: A balanced version of the dataset for model training.

### Documentation Files
1. **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
2. **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python libraries for running the code.

## How to Run the Code
